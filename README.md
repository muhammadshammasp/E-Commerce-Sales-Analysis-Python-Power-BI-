# üõí E-Commerce Sales Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes an **E-Commerce sales dataset** using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data cleaning and exploration, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboard visualizations.  
The goal is to identify trends, top-performing products, and customer behavior to support data-driven decision-making.

## üìÇ Dataset

  - `Quantity` - Number of units sold
  - `InvoiceDate` - Date of purchase
  - `UnitPrice` - Price per unit
  - `Country` - Customer's country
  - `CustomerID` - Unique customer identifier

## üõ† Steps Performed
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Jupyter Notebook)
